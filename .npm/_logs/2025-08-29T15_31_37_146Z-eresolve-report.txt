# npm resolution error report

While resolving: undefined@undefined
Found: @types/chai@5.2.2
node_modules/@types/chai
  dev @types/chai@"5.2.2" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @types/chai@"<5.2.0" from @types/chai-subset@1.3.6
node_modules/@types/chai-subset
  dev @types/chai-subset@"1.3.6" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
